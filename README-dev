MPRIA stands for Multi-Precision Rational Interval Arithmetic.

The development sources are available through git at Savannah:

  https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=mpria


Autotools
---------

This distribution uses recent versions of Automake, Autoconf and
Libtool; usually the latest ones released. If you are getting the
sources from git (or change configure.ac), you will need to have
these tools installed to (re)build. The autotools programs are
available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/.


Building
--------

After getting the git sources, and installing the tools above, you
can run

  autoreconf --install --force

to do a fresh build. After that first time, running the shell command
`./configure && make' should suffice.

When modifying the sources, or making a distribution, more is needed, as
follows:


GAP
---

This distribution also uses a recent version of GAP (Groups, Algorithms and
Programming --- a GPL Computer Algebra System) along with recent versions of
the IO and float GAP packages to (re)generate the C input tables needed within
the test suite; usually the latest ones released. The GAP software and packages
are available from http://www.gap-system.org/.


Valgrind
--------

The test suite that comes with the package transparently incorporates the
debugging and profiling suite tool valgrind. Running the shell command
`make check' should be sufficient. The valgrind suite of tools is available
from http://valgrind.org/.


Gnulib
------

This distribution contains two autoconf macro scripts imported by hand
from a recent version of Gnulib, namely m4/ld-version-script.m4 and
m4/valgrind-tests.m4. It might be necessary to update them by hand.
The Gnulib material is available from http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/.


GMP
---

This software library builds upon the GNU Multi-Precision library (GMP):
it is hightly recommanded to install and to build against a recent version
of the GMP library. The GMP library is available from http://gmplib.org/.


Happy hacking !
