Description:
 GNU MPRIA is intended to be a portable mathematical library written in C
 for rational interval arithmetic computations with arbitrary precision.

 The basic principle of rational interval arithmetic consists in enclosing
 every number by a rational interval containing it: each number is stored
 as its lower and upper endpoints and these bounds are rational numbers;
 their absolute difference measures the precision. The purpose is on the
 right hand to obtain guaranteed results, thanks to interval computation,
 and on the left hand to compute accurate results, thanks to arbitrary
 precision arithmetic.

 The arithmetic operations are extended for interval operands in such
 a way that the exact result of the operation belongs to the computed
 rational interval.

 The GNU MPRIA library is built upon the GNU MP library for operating
 on rational numbers; see http://gmplib.org/.

Installation:
 See the file ./INSTALL for building and installation instructions.

Bug reports:
 Please include enough information for the maintainers to reproduce the
 problem. Generally speaking, that means:
 - the contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug
   and command line invocations of the program(s) involved (crucial!).
 - a description of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.
 - the version number of the library involved (see mpria.h).
 - hardware, operating system, and compiler versions (uname -a).
 - unusual options you gave to configure, if any (see config.status).
 - anything else that you think would be helpful.

Patches: most welcome !
 If possible, please make them with diff -u and include ChangeLog entries.

Development environment:
 See README-dev for information on the development environment -- any
 interested parties are welcome.  If you're a programmer and wish to
 contribute, this should get you started.  If you're not a programmer,
 your help in writing test cases, checking the documentation against
 the implementation, etc., would still be very much appreciated.
